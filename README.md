# howdoi-intellij
IntelliJ IDEA plugin which uses howdoi-java library.

It was implemented and tested in IntelliJ IDEA 14.1 only.
It's context senstive and it returns relevant results for the language you're
working with. Also, it will perform a search for each line which contains a
cursor (IDEA supports multiple caret since version 13.1)

##Screenshots

A compiled version ready to install can be found inside build directory

This was my first ever IntelliJ IDEA plugin, so probably you'll find a lot of mistakes in the code ;)
